You can check everything else on official WorldGuard [GitHub page](https://github.com/EngineHub/WorldGuard).

WorldGuard-Translator
---------------------
__WGTranslator__ project was started just to make it easier to translate WorldGuard messages. Currently there's no other option but to edit source code of the plugin. 
So, why not to make it editable just from one single file?

`/wgtranslator` - reload messages file. It will warn you if anything is missing.
